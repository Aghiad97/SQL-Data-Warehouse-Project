# Project Overview

Welcome! This project was my first end-to-end implementation of a modern data warehouse, completed as part of my course. I focused on setting up a robust, scalable system that covers everything from raw data ingestion right through to final reports.

Here's a breakdown of the core technical areas I implemented:

### 1. Data Architecture: Medallion Framework

I designed the entire warehouse around the Medallion Architecture. This was crucial for ensuring data quality and organization. The flow is structured into three distinct layers:

Bronze: This is the initial landing zone where data is kept raw, exactly as it comes from the source systems.

Silver: Here, the raw data is cleaned, standardized, and de-duplicated. It represents a single source of truth for all enterprise data.

Gold: The final layer! This contains highly refined, aggregated, and optimized data ready for reporting and business intelligence (BI) tools.

### 2. ETL Pipelines & Workflows

I built the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines to manage the data movement. This involved writing the logic to:

Extract data from the various source systems.

Transform itâ€”this was the core work of cleaning, normalizing, and shaping the data based on business rules.

Load the processed data sequentially into the Silver and Gold layers.

### 3. Data Modeling

To support analytical speed and clarity, I implemented a Dimensional Model focused on optimization. This involved developing and populating:

Fact Tables: Holding quantitative, observable events (like sales transactions or measurements).

Dimension Tables: Holding descriptive attributes related to the facts (like customer names, dates, or product details).

### 4. Analytics & Reporting

The goal was to make the data actionable! I created and validated several key outputs:

I wrote specific SQL-based reports against the Gold layer to extract key business metrics.

I ensured the Gold tables were structured perfectly to feed BI dashboards, providing actionable insights to end-users.
